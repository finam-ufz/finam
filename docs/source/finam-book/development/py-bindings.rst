===============
Python bindings
===============

FINAM requires Python bindings for coupling components or models written in a language other than Python, like C++, Fortran or Rust.

Implementation of bindings is highly dependent on the language, as well as the approach.
Therefore, we provide a `repository with example projects <https://git.ufz.de/FINAM/pybind-examples>`_
for different languages and approaches.
