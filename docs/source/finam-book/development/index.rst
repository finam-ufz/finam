====================
Developing for FINAM
====================

The following chapters target developers that want to prepare their existing models for use in FINAM, or that want to write FINAM-compatible models from scratch.

Besides preparation of models, implementation of adapters that mediate data between models is also covered.

* Overview over FINAM's :doc:`interfaces`.
* :doc:`components`.
* :doc:`adapters`.
* :doc:`data_metadata` in FINAM.
* :doc:`connect_phase`.
* Implementing :doc:`special_components`.
* Using :doc:`logging`.
* Writing :doc:`py-bindings` for models in languages other than Python.
* :doc:`performance`.
