===============================
Documentation update & redesign
===============================

In preparation of the FINAM 0.4 release, the complete :doc:`documentation </index>` was reworked.
Of course, everything is up to date with the code now, but there is more:
Everything is in one place now; structure and layout are much clearer;
the :doc:`/finam-book/index` and the :doc:`/api/index` are heavily cross-referenced.

----

Large parts of the :doc:`/finam-book/index` were updated for all the upcoming changes for version 0.4.
Completely new chapters were added for metadata handling
(:doc:`/finam-book/principles/metadata` and :doc:`/finam-book/development/data_metadata`),
:doc:`/finam-book/development/connect_phase` and :doc:`/finam-book/development/special_components`.
Further, most code examples in the documentation are now automatically tested to help keeping them up to date in the future.

On the :doc:`/api/index` side, the documentation was restructured for better accessibility.
Further, API documentation was extended and examples were added to all end user-facing classes,
particularly in :mod:`.modules` and :mod:`.adapters`.

All the work was done by :ref:`author-sebastian-muller` and :ref:`author-martin-lange`.
